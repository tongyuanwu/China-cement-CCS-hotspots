# China-cement-CCS-hotspots
This repository contains the data processing scripts, analysis workflows, and outputs for identifying county-level hotspots for **carbon capture and storage (CCS)** deployment in China’s cement industry. The project aims to provide a spatially explicit assessment of where CCS could be most impactful, supporting decision-making for climate mitigation in the cement sector.
